## Usage

Install dependencies:

npm install
```

Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

Rename example.env to .env:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Change the value if your API runs on a different port or host.

## Authentication Flow

- Login/register returns an accessToken and sets a refreshToken in a secure, HTTP-only cookie.

- accessToken is stored in context and sent in the Authorization header.

- When the access token expires or there is a hard page refresh, the app automatically requests a new one using the refreshToken.
